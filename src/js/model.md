✅ Your Response Review: model.js Architecture
🔸 Q: What part of the UI changes when the timeframe changes?
Your Answer: Each grid activity card changes.

✅ Spot on.
You’ve correctly isolated the only dynamic element — the card content — not the structure or layout. That means your model doesn’t need to know about cards or layout — just timeframe-based data.

🔸 Q: What responsibilities should the view have no knowledge of?
Your Answer: The view shouldn’t know about:

The model

The JSON file

The app state

✅ Excellent boundary setting.

You understand that the view layer is passive — it waits to be told what to render, and doesn’t know or care where the data comes from.

That’s the essence of “separation of concerns.”

💡 You could add:

The view shouldn’t manipulate state (e.g., setActiveTimeframe) — that belongs in the model/controller.

🔸 Q: What should be dynamic vs static?
Dynamic: JSON data
Static: Timeframe toggle buttons

✅ Correct, with room to expand:

🧠 Advanced Thinking:
Technically, even the buttons could be rendered dynamically if you wanted maximum flexibility — but for now, since they're static in the Figma spec, treating them as static HTML is valid.

🔸 Q: “If the model gives me clean data, how do I visually represent it with consistent structure?”
Your Answer: The model is responsible for tracking app state and providing clean JSON data to the view.

✅ Yes — and here’s how to deepen this understanding:

🧠 Expand Your Mental Model of model.js
Let’s turn your strong instincts into sharper, scalable logic:

✅ model.js Should:
Own the App State

activeTimeframe: 'weekly'

data: [] (the raw JSON dataset)

Expose Mutator Functions

setTimeframe() updates the timeframe value

setData() stores the dataset (after fetch)

Expose Getter Functions

getActiveTimeframe() returns the string

getFormattedData() returns a cleaned version for rendering

🔁 Real-World Analogy
Think of model.js as your backend API layer in a real app:

You send it requests (setTimeframe)

It stores the state ('daily')

It gives you a filtered response (getDataForTimeframe())

You’ve nailed this abstraction. You’re thinking like someone who’s prepping for Angular’s service architecture (where state lives in @Injectable services).
